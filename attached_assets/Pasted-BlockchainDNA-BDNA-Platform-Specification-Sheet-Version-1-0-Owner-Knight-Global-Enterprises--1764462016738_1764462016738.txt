BlockchainDNA (BDNA) — Platform Specification Sheet
Version: 1.0 Owner: Knight Global Enterprises / Knight InfoTek Core Purpose: Universal Identity, Provenance, Behavior, and Compliance Chain for Human + AI + Asset Governance.

⭐ 1. Overview
BlockchainDNA (BDNA) is a next-generation governance chain designed to anchor identity, behavior, provenance, auditability, and regulatory compliance across:
* Humans
* AI Agents
* Digital Assets
* Real-World Assets (RWA)
* Wallets & Devices
* Organizations
* Autonomous Systems
BDNA serves as the trust substrate for regulated AI systems, tokenized finance, RWA markets, enterprise autonomy, and compliance-driven digital ecosystems.

* Financial event histories
* Audit events for regulated industries
* Cross-chain provenance metadata
External Integrations:
* DocumentBridge
* ChainBridge
* DataBridge

🔹 3.3 RuleEngine — Behavior / Policy Registry
Purpose: Defines allowed actions, agent scopes, and regulatory policies.
Capabilities:
* Policy enforcement
* Action whitelist/blacklist
* Real-time rule evaluation
* AI agent scope definitions
* Regulated industry “safety rails”
* Cross-agent policy inheritance
External Integrations:
* AgentBridge

🔹 3.6 AuthorityChain — Delegation / Roll-up Registry
Purpose: Models hierarchical responsibility: AI agents roll up to humans, humans roll up to organizations.
Capabilities:
* Delegated authority graphs
* Professional license → AI agent mapping
* Org chart-based permissions
* Legal responsibility anchoring
* Signature roll-up for liability
* Supervisory chains for regulated AI
External Integrations:
* WorkforceBridge
* LicenseBridge
* AgentBridge

🔹 3.7 AccessGate — Privacy / Permissions Registry
Purpose: Zero-knowledge selective disclosure & permissioned data access.
Capabilities:
* Role-based access
* ZK queries
* Private audit windows
* Regulatory-only disclosures
* Parental controls, custody controls
* Cross-org permissioning
External Integrations:
* ZKBridge
* EnterpriseBridge

⭐ 4. GenomeX — Behavioral Intelligence Layer
GenomeX is the AI behavioral brain that defines, fingerprints, monitors, and safeguards actions across all agents.

🔹 4.1 GenomeMap
Behavioral genome blueprint for AI agents, wallets, and devices. Models long-term behavioral tendencies and decision genetics.

🔹 4.2 PatternTags
High-speed tagging of behaviors, violations, sentiments, intents, and risk signals.
