## Product Overview Section

### Product Name
**ZK30-Gladiator with Blockchain-Anchored Behavioral Snapshot Recovery (BSR)**

### Tagline
**Autonomous AI Defense Platform with Instant Self-Healing**

### Product Description

ZK30-Gladiator is the world's first autonomous AI defense platform featuring Blockchain-Anchored Behavioral Snapshot Recovery (BSR). Unlike traditional security solutions, ZK30-Gladiator combines behavioral analysis, local AI reasoning, and blockchain attestation to provide proactive threat detection and instant file recovery.

**Key Capabilities:**
- Proactive threat detection through behavioral analysis
- Instant selective file recovery (< 10 seconds)
- Immutable blockchain integrity proof
- Air-gap compatible for classified environments
- Zero-day resilience through pattern detection

## Core Features

### 1. Blockchain-Anchored Behavioral Snapshot Recovery (BSR)

**Industry-First Innovation**

BSR is the signature feature of ZK30-Gladiator, combining:
- **BehaviorPrint Generation**: Comprehensive file identity with process lineage
- **Behavioral Snapshot Graph (BSG)**: Complete file version lineage tracking
- **Clean State Anchors (CSA)**: Blockchain-anchored trusted states
- **GenomeX AI Scoring**: AI-powered behavioral risk assessment
- **Delta Snapshot Storage**: Efficient binary diff storage
- **Instant Recovery**: Selective file restoration in seconds

**Benefits:**
- Restore only corrupted files, not entire systems
- Cryptographic proof of clean states
- Complete behavioral context preservation
- Minimal storage overhead (< 20%)
