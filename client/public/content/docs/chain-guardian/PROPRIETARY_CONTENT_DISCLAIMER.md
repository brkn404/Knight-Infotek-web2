## Content Review Process

All knowledge base content has been reviewed to ensure:

1. ✅ No proprietary algorithms are disclosed
2. ✅ No specific implementation details are revealed
3. ✅ No trade secrets are exposed
4. ✅ All specific values are generalized or removed
5. ✅ High-level descriptions only
6. ✅ Public information only

---

## Examples of Generalization

### Before (Proprietary)
```
Risk Score = (contentType * 0.4) + (patterns * 0.3) + (signatures * 0.1) + ...
```

### After (Public)
```
Risk Score uses a weighted multi-factor algorithm considering content type, patterns, signatures, size, and context.
Note: Specific weights and formulas are proprietary.
