- **Every 39 seconds** a cyberattack occurs
- **95% of breaches** are caused by human error

### Why Traditional Solutions Are Failing

**Current cybersecurity approaches are broken:**

| Traditional Approach | Why It Fails |
|---------------------|--------------|
| **Signature-based detection** | Can't catch new threats (zero-days) |
| **Human-dependent response** | Too slow (30+ minutes average) |
| **Cloud-based processing** | Privacy risks, network dependency |
| **Reactive defense** | Always one step behind attackers |
| **Generic solutions** | Doesn't adapt to your environment |

### The Human Factor Problem

**Critical shortage of cybersecurity talent:**
- **3.4 million** unfilled cybersecurity positions globally
- **Average salary** of $120,000+ for cybersecurity professionals
- **Companies spend 40%** of their cybersecurity budget on personnel
- **24/7 monitoring** requires multiple shifts and constant attention
