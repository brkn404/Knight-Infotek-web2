## Review Date
January 2025

## Status
✅ **COMPLETE** - All proprietary content has been removed or generalized

---

## Changes Made

### 1. Risk Scoring System

**Removed**:
- Specific weight percentages (40%, 30%, 10%, etc.)
- Exact scoring formulas with numeric values
- Specific point values for risk factors
- Detailed calculation examples with proprietary numbers

**Replaced With**:
- General descriptions of risk factors
- High-level algorithm descriptions
- Generic examples without specific values
- Notes indicating proprietary nature of algorithms

**Files Updated**:
- `articles/RISK_SCORING.md`
- `PRODUCT_SPEC_SHEET.md`
- `faqs/GENERAL_FAQS.md`
- `faqs/TECHNICAL_FAQS.md`

### 2. Behavioral Analysis

**Removed**:
- Specific threshold values (>0.1, >0.2, >100/hour)
- Exact risk adjustment values (+20, +30, +15)
- Detailed genome generation algorithms
- Specific feature calculation methods

**Replaced With**:
- General behavioral feature descriptions
- High-level risk adjustment descriptions
- Generic profile classifications
- Notes indicating proprietary algorithms

**Files Updated**:
- `articles/BEHAVIORAL_ANALYSIS.md`

### 3. Hash Verification

**Removed**:
- Specific partial matching algorithms
- Exact fuzzy matching implementation details
- Specific database structure information
- Detailed matching threshold values

**Replaced With**:
- General matching method descriptions
- High-level accuracy statements
- Generic database type descriptions
- Notes indicating proprietary methods

**Files Updated**:
- `articles/HASH_VERIFICATION.md`

### 4. Architecture Diagrams

**Enhanced**:
- Added comprehensive disclaimer
- Listed all proprietary information categories
- Clarified what is and isn't disclosed

**Files Updated**:
- `ARCHITECTURE_DIAGRAM.md`

### 5. New Documentation

**Created**:
- `PROPRIETARY_CONTENT_DISCLAIMER.md` - Comprehensive disclaimer document
- `PROPRIETARY_CONTENT_REVIEW_SUMMARY.md` - This summary document
