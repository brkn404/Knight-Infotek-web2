## Key Features Section

### Feature 1: Behavior-First Security
**Understand Context, Not Just Content**

Go beyond static file hashing to understand *how* and *why* files change. Behavioral analysis detects mutations that traditional security misses, including zero-day attacks and sophisticated threats.

---

### Feature 2: Instant Selective Recovery
**Restore Files in Seconds, Not Hours**

BSR enables selective file restoration—only fix what's broken. Recover from ransomware, corruption, or tampering in less than 10 seconds per file, with minimal operational impact.

---

### Feature 3: Blockchain-Anchored Integrity
**Immutable Proof of Clean States**

Clean State Anchors (CSAs) provide cryptographic proof of file integrity. Blockchain attestation ensures recovery points cannot be tampered with, providing complete audit trails for compliance.

### Feature 4: AI-Powered Autonomous Defense
**Local LLM Reasoning, Zero Cloud Dependency**

ORACLE AI engine analyzes threats in real-time using local LLMs. No data leaves your infrastructure, ensuring privacy and enabling air-gapped operation for classified environments.

---

### Feature 5: Air-Gap Compatible
**Full Offline Operation**

Designed for high-security environments, ZK30-Gladiator operates completely offline. No internet connectivity required—perfect for classified networks, SCADA systems, and isolated environments.

### Feature 6: Zero-Day Resilience
**Detect Novel Attacks Through Behavioral Patterns**

Behavioral pattern detection identifies threats that signature-based systems miss. Proactive detection of zero-day exploits, APTs, and fileless malware before damage occurs.

## How It Works Section

### Step 1: Continuous Monitoring
**Behavioral Analysis in Real-Time**

ZK30-Gladiator continuously monitors system events, generating BehaviorPrints for file changes that include process lineage, change patterns, and behavioral context.

### Step 2: AI-Powered Threat Assessment
**ORACLE Analyzes and Scores**

The ORACLE AI engine analyzes behavioral patterns, generating risk scores and threat classifications. GenomeX scoring identifies clean, unknown, suspicious, and malicious states.

### Step 3: Blockchain Attestation
**Immutable Clean State Anchors**

Trusted file states are cryptographically signed and stored in the BDNA ChainLedger, providing immutable proof of integrity that cannot be tampered with.

### Step 4: Instant Recovery
**Selective File Restoration**

When corruption is detected, BSR locates the last clean state via Behavioral Snapshot Graph (BSG) and restores only corrupted files from delta snapshots in seconds.

## Use Cases Section

### Use Case 1: Ransomware Recovery
**Minutes vs. Days**

Traditional recovery takes hours or days. ZK30-Gladiator BSR restores encrypted files in seconds, minimizing downtime and operational impact.
